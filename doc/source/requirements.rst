Requirements
------------

CAMMAClib and notebooks heavily rely on `CliMAF
<https://climaf.readthedocs.io>`_ for implementing data access, for
computations (mainly using `CDO
<https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo>`_ behind the curtain) and
for ploting figures (using `Ncl <https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/>`_ behind
the curtain). CliMAF is designed for easing both the description of data
organization and the integration of user scripts. Because CliMAF has a built-in knowledge
of CMIP6 data organization on the ESPRI platform, a slight adaptation has to be
done for using CAMMAC on other platforms (see :ref:`adapting_for_data`)
